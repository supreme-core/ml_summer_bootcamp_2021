'''

train.csv
Survival - Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes). Not included in test.csv file.
Pclass - Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
Name - Name
Sex - Sex
Age - Age
Sibsp - Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
Parch - Number of Parents/Children Aboard
Ticket - Ticket Number
Fare - Passenger Fare
Cabin - Cabin
Embarked - Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

Variable Notes
pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
